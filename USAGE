NAME
    jac2dat - Convert .jac files to various data formats

SYNOPSIS
        perl jac2dat.pl [jac_files ...] [-all] [-det=det_file]
                        [-dat_fmts=ext ...] [-dat_path=path]
                        [-nofm] [-nopause]

DESCRIPTION
        jac2dat converts .jac files to various data formats.
        - JAC file: The gamma spectra format of the Science and Technology Agency,
                    (now the MEXT) Japan. For details, refer to the catalogue of
                    DS-P1001 Gamma Station, SII.
                    A .jac file consists of only one column, in which
                    gamma counts are stored in ascending order of channels.
                    The first three records are "not" gamma counts, and
                    are used for special purposes:
                    - Record 1: Live time (duration)
                    - Record 2: Real time (duration)
                    - Record 3: Acquired time
        - DAT file: A plottable text file converted from a .jac file.
                    A .dat file consists of multiple columns, in which
                    channels, gamma energies, peak FWHMs, peak efficiencies,
                    counts, count per second (cps), gammas, and
                    gamma per second (gps) are stored.
        - Other supported data formats include tex, csv, xlsx, json, and yaml.

OPTIONS
        jac_files ...
            .jac files to be converted.

        -all (short form: -a)
            All .jac files in the current working directory will be converted.

        -detector=det_file (short form: -det)
            A file containing conversion formulas of a detector
            such as channel-to-energy and channel-to-FWHM formulas.
            Key-value pairs contained in this file take precedence
            over the predefined formulas.
            Refer to the sample file 'detector.j2d' for the syntax.

        -dat_fmts=ext ... (short: -fmts, default: dat)
            Data formats. Multiple formats are separated by the comma (,).
            all
                All of the following ext's.
            dat

        -dat_path=path (short: -path, default: current working directory)
            The path in which the converted data files will be stored.

        -nofm
            Do not show the front matter at the beginning of the program.

        -nopause
            Do not pause the shell at the end of the program.
